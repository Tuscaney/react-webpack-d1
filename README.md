# react-webpack-d1

Small React app created from the react-webpack-codex scaffold.

## What I built
- Removed the starter example UI
- Created `src/components/Greeting.jsx` which renders `Hello, React world!`
- App renders `<Greeting />`

## Setup / Run
1. Install dependencies (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   npm install
